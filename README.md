## Introduction
This plugin is designed to allow players to set Prefixes/Suffixes, based on the amount of "tokens" they have.   

## To do list:
* Prefix/Suffix commands 
  * Check filtered string against regex list
  * optional additions to be added to the final string
  * display final prefix to player + confirmation
  * send complete suffix to LP
  * add support for dynamic list of regex filters (CR Ep11)
* Console command to add/remove meta tokens.
* Gui to display all set prefixes with option to toggle (Probably not any time soon)
* Add hex support? maybe Gradients?
