## Introduction
This plugin is designed to allow players to set Prefixes/Suffixes, based on the amount of "tokens" they have.   

## To do list:
* Prefix/Suffix commands
  * Check string against regex list
  * optional additions to be added to the final string
* Gui to display all set prefixes with option to toggle (Probably not any time soon.)
